                <h2>October of 1990</h2>
                <p>Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that remain the foundation of today’s web (and
                    which you may have seen appear on parts of your web browser):
                <p><span>&#9679HTML:</span> HyperText Markup Language. The markup (formatting) language for the web.</p>
                <p><span>&#9679URI:</span> Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of “address” that is unique and used to
                    identify to each resource on the web. It is also commonly called a URL.</p>
                <p><span>&#9679HTTP:</span> Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the retrieval of linked resources
                    from across the web.</p>
